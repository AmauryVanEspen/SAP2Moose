A project to extract model data from a SAP system into the analysis platform Moose on Pharo Smalltalk. It uses FAMIX as a flexible enhancable meta model to do this. 

See [Wiki](https://github.com/RainerWinkler/Moose-FAMIX-SAP-Extractor/wiki) for further details and the [Blog on SAP developer network](https://scn.sap.com/community/abap/custom-code-management/blog/2016/03/13/solving-sap-problems-without-reading-code--extract-a-famix-model-to-moose).

I would like to thank especially:

*Damir Majer* for many helpfull discussions and especially for inviting Tudor Girba to the SAP Inside Track Munich 2015, thus indirectly initiating this project

*Tudor Girba* for many valuable informations and tips on how to use Moose and FAMIX

*Enno Wulff* for making a 7.31 version available and many discussions to improve the extractor and to give hints on what can be done

And all *colleagues* that made this tool possible!
